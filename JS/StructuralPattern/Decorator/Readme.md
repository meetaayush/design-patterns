# Decorator Pattern
The decorator pattern focuses on adding properties, functionalities and behaviour to existing classes dynamically.

## When to use?
- Use the decorator pattern when you want to easily modify or extend the functionality of an object without changing its base code.

- It can also be used if an application has a lot of distinct objects with the same underlying code. Instead of creating all of them using different subclasses, additional functionalities can be added to the objects using the decorator pattern.

- A simple example is text formatting, where you need to apply different formattings such as bold, italics, and underline to the same text.
