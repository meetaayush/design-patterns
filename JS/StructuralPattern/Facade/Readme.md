# Facade Design Pattern
This pattern provides simpler interface that hides complex functionalities of the system

The facade pattern allows you to hide all the messy logic from the client and only display the clear and easy-to-use interface to them. This allows them to interact with an API easily in a less error-prone way and without accessing the inner workings directly.
