# Buidler Pattern
The builder pattern is a type of creational pattern that helps in building complex objects using simpler objects. It provides a flexible and step-by-step approach towards making these objects. It also keeps the representation and process of creation shielded.

## When to use?
You can use this design pattern when building apps that require you to create complex objects. It can help you hide the construction process of building these objects.

A good example would be a DOM, where you might need to create plenty of nodes and attributes. The construction process can get quite messy if you are building a complex DOM object. In cases like these, the builder pattern can be used.
