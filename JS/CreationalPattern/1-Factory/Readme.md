# Factory pattern
- Provides a template which can be used to create objects.
- Used in places where the type of object required varies and needs to be specified in each case.
- Does not use use the `new` keyword. Rather it delegates the object creation responsibility to corresponding subclass.

> We can use this pattern when we want to create different objects with similar characteristics.
